IPC-Bridge udmamrl/ipc-bridge forked from nmichael/ipc-bridge

    Include IPC v3.9.1 ros package from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~IPC/

You will need to set up the ROS paths appropriately. 

You will also need to set the MEX variable in your environment:

export MEX=/path/to/matlab/bin/mex

This will vary based on your system, install path, etc.


example installation using rosws , tested in Ubuntu 12.04 x64 

    cd ~/ros
    rosws set ipc-bridge --version=master --git https://github.com/udmamrl/ipc-bridge.git
    source ~/ros/setup.sh
    rosws update ipc-bridge

    # Compile ipc ipc-3.9.1

    # Then in the end of the script it will run rosmake ipc to generate libipc.a libipc.so central
   
    roscd ipc && ./ipc_make.sh
    
    # Then run easy make script for all messages, you have to hit enter for each message.
